  "word": "Atheist",
  "short_description": "Atheist There are two in-use definitions of the word &apos;atheist&apos;:  1.) A person who lacks belief in a [god] or gods.  People who use this definition categorize atheists as either negative (or implicit or weak) atheists or positive (or explicit or strong) atheists.  Negative atheists, while they don&apos;t believe in a god, do not positively assert that no gods exist.  Positive atheists, however, do.  2.) A person who believes that no god or gods exist.  Those who consider themselves atheists (who are usually positive atheists) tend to define &apos;atheist&apos; using the former definition, and those who believe in a god or gods tend to define &apos;atheist&apos; using the latter.  In both cases, this seems to be a demagogic practice intended to classify either as many or as few people as atheists as possible.  Negative atheists are usually referred to as [agnostic]s.  While neither definition of atheism entails any personality traits of atheists or of those who do believe in a god or gods (sometimes referred to as &apos;[theist]s&apos;), both atheists and theists tend to believe that certain traits apply to all atheists/theists.  Common myths about atheists include: all atheists are arrogant, immoral, rebellious, and/or intolerant; all atheists really believe in (the Christian) God and are simply in denial; all atheists are depressed and believe life is meaningless.  Common myths about theists include: all theists are naive and/or intolerant; all theists don&apos;t really believe in their god(s) and just pretend to because they&apos;re afraid that if people realised that no god exists, there will be complete chaos; all theists are weak and look to their god(s) for comfort.  It hardly needs to be said that while these myths apply to a select few individuals in each group, the claim that they apply to every atheist or every theist is false.  Negative atheists justify their lack of belief in god(s) by pointing out that no evidence exists for the existence of god(s), and justify their lack of disbelief by pointing out that no evidence exists for the nonexistence thereof.  Positive atheists often assert that while no evidence for god(s) exists, it should be by default assumed that they do not, until evidence is found.  Some also try to use [logic] to prove that God does not exist, but this is often attached by theists and weak atheists as being mere wordplay.  Some theists and weak atheists also assert that logic is superficial and meaningless (which is an easily refutable claim), and that only one&apos;s inner feelings can lead them to truth.  Some positive atheists (and [deist]s), however, are led to their stance through their feelings.  Some feel that because the world is filled with evil and malice, and all-loving, benevolent god cannot exist.  Those who are led to their stance through this feeling, however, cannot justify their disbelief in a malevolent god in the same way.  Some reject the idea of the Christian God because the [Bible] states that non-Christians are condemned to [Hell], and reject the idea as being too disturbing.  While the same argument can also be made against the gods of various other religions, including [Islam] and [Zoroastrianism], it cannot be made against every god (in Judaism, for example, Hell does not exist).",

The one I know of currently, has a great smile that would even make you smile at one of your days, a good listening ability, deep and   eyes that express more than his face which he constantly hides (besides his smile) and a great sense of humour that many would assume he didnt have. He's definitely one of the people whom many people would like once they enter an Adams'   where they would understand why he is the way he is. One of the best people I know.  , weird, talented, caring,  , and basically perfect. Someone who I love more than anything  , and a person who I know I can always depend upon. A man who sits at home on a computer and reads definitions about his own name.   if some of these may be written by people who actually know him. He is in-fact   somewhat good looking but still   why he is single. Secretly a big nerd but the most caring man when it comes to ones he loves or Girlfriends he once loved."

The album's blistering hardcore punk had elements of gothic lyrics in it. \r A year later they came out with the Fire Inside EP, and they had officially changed their acronym to A Fire Inside (formerly Asking For It).

This album pleased both their old and new fans with a variety of songs.

As their father I thought it important that I should understand what it means since they wear so many of these shirts so I looked it up online and found no   definition.  Since so many people wear these clothes and they look nice the word should have a meaningful definition so I've created one.  From now on, A\u00e9ropostale now means \"I Love My Daddy\". Despite the   monkeys and butterflies,   has good quality clothing for half the price of American Eagle or  .  It is, by no means, a 'wannabe prep store'; it is a store for people who like their fashionable and comfortable aparrel and have more sense than to waste money on a worse quality, over-priced Abercrombie shirt.

Aeropostale is a teen clothing store that is commonly grouped with Abercrombie & Fitch,  ., and American Eagle. However, it is also regarded as the \"cheapest\" of the group. This may or may not be true, because they are generally the same in quality, but the other   original prices on their items are much higher (especially   and  , which sell T-shirts for $38 in a heartbeat).  sells clothes and other items (jewelry, sunglasses, bags, etc.) for both females and males. From personal experience, I notice that a lot of people well above their teen years still shop here, for some reason. Although most styles are meant for younger people, the simpler and more basic things can be stretched to people of at most 8 years older. Lately, it seems that Aeropostale has been taking cues from the other three main teen retailers. They have removed   and butterflies from their clothes and general image, and instead replaced it with a more clean and \"mature\" \"A87\" logo. Their models and advertisements generally use the same people all the time, unlike the other stores (probably more  ). Also, they are always   and doing fun,   things instead of a more romantic and mature theme like A&F and HCO use. This new advertising (as well as the logo) is probably used to attract more of   that go to the other three, rather than thinking of Aero as a monkey-butterfly-glittery-kiddish brand. Their original selling price can also hurt your wallet if you are on a tight budget. Their sales are much better than A&F and HCO, however. Stuff can get extremely cheap, especially near the ends of the seasons. Aero hires people of all shapes and sizes and doesn't hire based on looks, as A&F and HCO are known to do. Seeing as most people were slightly disturbed by the butterflies and monkeys, I'm guessing Aero will make an even bigger name for itself in teen retail in the near future. It's a good place to shop, in my opinion.  an awesome store that is ALOT cheaper than Abercrombie. (I have nothing against Abercrombie tho except that they are pretty expensive) If you shop there it doesn't mean you're a poser, or you're poser, it means you've got taste but you're not going to pay $35 for a shirt that will   the day you put it in  .

A mental disorder that is poorly understood by many. Contrary to popular belief, people with   aren't retarded. They just don't learn like most other people do. This, in turn, pisses off the faculty at school, and they make everyone around you aware of of your disorder, and since your non adhd classmates don't understand your disorder either, you'll be labeled as different, guaranteeing that you'll be made fun of multiple times. Despite this, adhd people tend to be more intelligent than those who do well in public schools. They don't pay attention in class because guess what stupid teachers? Your class is useless to them and boring as shit, not because they suck at learning. Most kids with adhd are highly creative. After the hell they endure at school, they usually go on to be successful at life and never look back. Famous examples of these people: Albert Einstein,  ,   (baseball legend), will smith, Michael phelps (  medalist swimmer), robin Williams (RIP),  , and way too many people to list have adhd and go on to do incredible things.  is  a very real disorder that is over diagnosed. People with ADHD have difficulty sitting still, being quiet, and focusing   at length. These sensations are difficult to explain unless you have them; it is not that the person does not want to focus, or that they are stupid. When someone with ADHD tries to focus on something, the thought often slips away, or  is replaced by another thought - minutes later they will realize they have lost focus.\r \r When a person who does not have ADHD takes ADHD medication, they get high. When a person with ADHD takes ADHD medication, they feel calm, and can focus on things for the first time in their lives.\r \r  People with behavioral issues unrelated to the disorder ( , seeking attention, etc.) are often  incorrectly diagnosed with ADHD. People who just want the diagnosis so they can get their hands on ADHD drugs will pretend to have ADHD symptoms, as well. This is very frustrating, as it diminishes the integrity of those who actually have ADHD, and require medicine to be able to function like normal people can.\r \r People with ADHD are often above average in intelligence. When they are given medication and can function without a mental handicap keeping them down, their whole lives can change for the better. An absolute   that lets a small sample of people have the ability to actually see this generations version of \"normal\" for the mundane bullshit it is. If it was for people like this, its likely the word would  ,  and advancments in science and art would never happen. Usally a person with ADHD already \"gets\" wtf a teacher is saying 2 minutes into her elementary   lesson, and their brains branch to deeper thoughts that need answering, vice the simple bullshit that is still, and will continue to come of her mouth for the next 5 days.  ADHD stands for attention deficit somethingk.  Hey! I spelled something wrong.  Haha.  Hey look a squirrel.  Wait,   here again?    my elbow itches.  Wonder what's on tv?  I like Jennifer Lopez.  I hate kumquats.  I really love urbandictionar.....  again? .. Over diagnosed  . For those that really are ADHD it sucks. The people that are \"normal\" take adderall,  etc to study for tests while we have to take it every fucking day just so we can sit through class without getting distracted by the lamest things.  Attention Deficit/  Disorder.  Most commonly found in children, the main symptoms of this disorder is a   and too much activity or excessive daydreaming.    is the drug of choice to treat ADHD."

The album tells the story, which takes place in the time span of about one year, through exploring the thoughts of each character as well as through dialog and interactions between the characters. While the plot is more of an abstract concept than it is a direct story, the message is fairly clear: the American youth remain unheard because of the &quot;I don&apos;t care&quot; attitude many of them carry, but because of the lack of actual dialogue, the root of this attitude is the fact that the American youth only know what they DON&apos;T want, and have never been presented with a reasonable option that they COULD want. Of course the ending of the story is, unfortunately, also an all-too-common reality in our current world.  The album/story also tells a typical teen-angst-style love story that applies a double meaning to the cover (which is a hand holding a heart-shaped grenade).  The album is expected to receive negative criticism (especially by those who don&apos;t take the time to truly understand the story or are too quick to judge and disregard it as &quot;left-wing propaganda&quot;), since it was considered a highly experimental concept from the very beginning.

Generally mis-labeled as a \"prep store\" despite the fact that an actual prep wouldn be caught dead wearing   or anything like that. Cheaper than places like abercrombie and  ., with a more conservative and clean- cut style. Ignorant people who hate   called   in school (that generally wear these sort of clothes) like to bash this store, disgracing websites like urbandictionary.com. In addition AE has a GUYS SECTION, so just because a guy (like me) likes to wear clothes from this store DOES NOT make them gay or bisexual. A store which sells   for those who like that vintage style. Easy to wear with many other brands, and although somewhat overpriced, thats the way business works. the Sale rack is usually great. Just because some people choose to wear what they like doesnt mean they're rich snobs, it can simply mean they like   they're wearing. Maybe they're not rich and saved up to buy the shirt. Just because you dislike  , doesnt mean that anyone who wears it is preppy or a bitch.\r \r pretty stupid to judge someone by what they wear. a clothing store for teenagers with a generally \"preppy\" style. it doesnt say anything about your personality if you shop there. and you should not be   a bitch just because you like an   shirt. half the people leaving ae definitions have most likely never worn ae   gone into one of their stores. my god! 1.   used as a   of the United States \r \r 2. A clothing store located in many different shopping  . People buy stuff there. a less expensive version of abercrombie. they have cool   clothing, unlike abercrombie.     because they don't have the brand on every single shirt they sell."

As far as I'm concerned, they're both great sports with their own challenges. An excellent indie rock/  from the 1990s,   by Mike   (of Owen). American Football originates from the English sport of  . It is played between two teams on a field of 100 yards (120 total including the end zones) with a brown oval shaped object called a Football. A team\u2019s objective is to get it\u2019s offense on the field as often as possible (to score) and keep the opponent\u2019s offense off the field when possible, and limit their performance when they are on. Team\u2019s score by driving the ball down the field by running and passing. The most common form of scoring is the touchdown (six points), followed by field goals (3), and (rarely) safeties (2). Immediately following the scoring of a touchdown the scoring team is given the option of performing a   (worth  ) or the point-after-touchdown (PAT, 1 point). Field goals and PATs are scored by kicking the Football between a tall   located behind the end zone. Professional and   games last full 60-minutes while high school games normally run at 48. It\u2019s important to note that due to timeouts and play huddling Football games normally last between 3 and 4 hours. \r \r Critics (normally foreign) seek to compare the playing style of American Football to Rugby. This is inaccurate, however. They are two different sports. While in Football certain positions require significantly larger stature and others do not,   positions in Rugby require relatively large size. Linebackers, Tight Ends, Full Backs and (larger) Quarterbacks are often suitable for Rugby while positions such as Safeties, Half Backs, and Cornerbacks are normally not.   can also suitable for Rugby play but few are. Unlike Rugby, American Football is a strategic sport and hence more importance is placed upon skill in positions. This, along with size differences, is why players rarely play both defense and offense.\r \r Unlike Rugby, by rule, Football play requires one wears protective gear. While in Rugby very large players tend to tackle other very large players, in Football very large players tend to tackle players inferior in size to them which can result in higher rates of injury. In addition to this, turf is becoming increasingly common as a replacement for grass in Football   again reinforcing the necessity for protective gear. Attire includes a hard helmet with  , numbered jersey for identification, shoulder and chest pads, tight pants with  , knee, and thigh pads, and  . Regardless of protective gear, Football has a higher injury rate than Rugby.\r \r It is played on High School,  , and Professional (namely NFL) levels. Rules are generally the same throughout all levels but differ to varying degrees by league and skill level. American Football\u2019s popularity rages in America overwhelmingly as the most-watched sport, but has failed to catch on in popularity in   (only Canada has a variation). Because of this, however, it remains a trademark of   culture.\r   a controlled  : pads ain't going to help you when you have a 250 lb guy taking a helmet-shoulder shot at  .

As such, there is a degree of   between anarchists and libertarian Marxists. Many anarchists are highly supportive of the practice of the Zapatistas in Chiapas. 1. Apparently an ideology Urban Dictionary has deemed to be appropriate to   upon, by marketing \" , tshirts and  \". A form of society based around the lack of a   and an emphasis on individual freedom and equality. An ideal form of anarchy would involve a cooperative socialist gift economy, in which goods are freely produced and distributed according to need. Crime would not be the huge problem most people would imagine. Anyone with a   of history knows that crime was never a huge problem until   and then  . A focus on community and civic responsibility would nearly eliminate violent crime (smaller, tightly knit communities have virtually no crime, even today). Property crime would be even a less of a problem, given that no one has more than anyone else and destruction of   would be destruction of one's own property. In case a crime is committed, any and every member of the community is capable of either preventing the crime before hand or apprehending the criminal afterwards, a system which worked for thousands of years before police forces became common during the Industrial Revolution. A common argument against such a system is that \"human nature\" would eventually lead to a return of capitalism and the establishment of government. This is not a part of \"human nature\", however. Human beings have almost no instincts at birth. A tendency towards government and capitalism is a product of societal conditioning, not a natural inclination. There have been examples of similar systems working in the real world, including many in Spain during the Revolutions of the late 1930's. Living standards generally increased in these areas.

As   Hennacy said, \"Oh, judge, your damn laws, the good people don't need them and the bad people don't follow them, so what good are they?\" Like I said before, if   were to happen right now chaos would probably ensue, but this largely due to how fucked up our governments have let the world become.\r \r Government is an unneccessary evil. The idea that people should be bound by agreements their ancestors made is absurd. I believe I am   to run my own life that George Bush is.\r \r If you ever see   dumbass in an anarchy shirt from hot topic,   it in textbooks at school, I want you to ask them to explain anarchy to you. Chances are they have no fucking clue as to what they're talking about and will tell you that they want chaos so that they can blow things up and drink. Punch them in the face for me.\r \r Anarchy would be a very bad idea to try right now.     is better left as an ideal for people who do get it. It's not something worth arguing about over the internet, because anarchy is not going to happen on a large enough scale to matter in anyone's lifetime who is alive today, and if there was anarchy, there probably wouldn't be an internet for very long ;).  is the only way to respect people. It is based on self-knowledge: when you deeply   and you're in contact with your nature, you have a perfect contact with other human beings and you can understand everyone's needs.

Generally speaking, she can write songs that make sense and she can sing at some point. She used to dress and act like an angry   but she changed her style since her third album released.

She then sings songs like \"Hot\" and \"Girlfriend\" and wears revealing clothes. She often claims that she is not a pop star but in fact she is. Basically, her songs are just pop songs with some rock beats. Since her third album, her style changed to more pop, but she thinks it's girly punk. She now tries to act gothic, and have launched a fashion line of clothes and perfumes(one called \"Forbidden Rose\"). However, despite that many think she's fake and arrogant(she pretended having baby just for fun), there are still many, most are teenagers, love and support her. She is commercially successful.

I'll admit that although she might be a nice person I'm not a fan of her personallity as she contradictis herself a lot by saying in one interview \"I can play guitar\" and in another \"I can't play guitar  \". same thing with skating. I do however like her music. but most people think she sucks because of her personallity and the things she says. but what they need to do is judge not by personallity but by music. if they think the music sucks then yes hate away but   on a band or singer because of personallity. that's just stupid. download something of hers. see for yourself. but I figured that someone in here needed to put down something at least a little bit good. noun.

Lastly, half the people that bash us are allies with us. Our country has relations in more than half the world. Most likely, we're best friends. I'm not even American, so don't just   this off as 'An American trying to defend themself and their country.'\r \r I myself am Canadian, and although SOME Americans are fat, idiotic, ignorant  , many are the exact opposite. A lot of Americans (probably the majority) are genuine, hardworking people who do the best they can to provide for their family with what they have. Many hate Bush, and are glad Obama's taken his position, hoping that it'll lead to more peaceful and better living. Not all of them wanted to even go into Iraq in the first place, and even though the stereotype for Americans are fat and stupid, many of them don't deserve it, and if you think that 300,000,000 people are   asses, you are extremely  .

Unfortunately,they're often stereotyped by other countries to be obese and lazy  .Some of them are,but many are not.Plus,every country   lazy obese slobs. Speaking of an \"typical american\" is as stupid as speaking of an \"typical european\", even worse I believe, though most of them have at least one language in common compared to europe with its   of utterly different languages.\r \r But nonetheless, regarding my own humble experience, I found most americans   really kind, straight, honest and generous people, and despite these qualities, they can be quite (irritating) modestly too. I believe even behind the \"fuck off, leave me alone\"-attitude, some of them have, you still may find a big,   heart in the right place. They live, struggle and suffer as we all do, well, probably in a more intense way. A lot of them have managed to create incredible beautiful and touching things like art, literature, music and other amazing or insane stuff while they have been living in the worst nightmare you can't nor you like to imagine at all. You won't find this special kind of strength and creativity very often outside america. Especially their music can tell you a lot about them; if you're   and dig deeper.\r \r  their culture is quite  , from an european point of view, but this is because they're often just freaking good in what they do, and the \"language\" they speak is one everyone can understand. Since the U.S., as well as Canada, were founded by people who came or   from every   place of this planet, americans are the sum of all these origins.  . So, from a different view, we're all americans. If you want to see one, just look into a mirror. If you hate them, you probably just hate yourself.\r \r Regarding U.S. residents, I hope, wish and pray they get their act together again, that they get over all this sad shit they suffer from and rise like a  .

Contrary to popular opinion, not all Americans are fat, eat at McDonalds, drive 4 SUVs, or think their country is the best.

SUVs are becoming less common, and there is now a growing number of   on the road. Driving a Peugot around on an interstate highway wouldn't be as   a Prius, but still very efficient.

The US is the world's lone  , but whether it is the \"best\" is subjective and must be based on many variables. Most the negative definitions about the US come from Americans themselves.

America is a huge country, so there are definitely many nutcases out there, but you can't judge an entire country based on a few pricks on the internet.
