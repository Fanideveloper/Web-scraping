But there was an aluminum box outside the front door and the milk truck came and the driver put the glass milk bottles in it and then when you were finished you put the empty glass bottles back in the aluminum box and he picked them up and put more milk in there. To be honest I completely forgot about that until you asked this question. That was like in the late 1950s into the \u201860s or something when I was a little kid. Seems kind of weird now. But there were others weird things going on like when you went to get gas they always pumped it, no self service and they always checked your oil and washed your windshield. Every single time. And I remember being in my early teens and being able to go and buy cigarettes they didn\u2019t ID you or anything. And when you went to the supermarket you bought your food but they bagged it and put it a little conveyor belt system that went from inside the store to the outside and you pulled your car up and there was a guy there to take your bags out of the bin and put them in the trunk of your car or in your backseat or whatever. They were just \u2018weird\u2019 things going on. You interacted more with people actually. I think people basically trusted one another more also",

FDR was finally able to get an aid package passed that sent bombers and arms to England but it wasn't until the attack on Pearl Harbor that the American people and government changed their minds about participation. And it was almost too late. By the time America joined the war, Hitler had already invaded most of Europe and Northern Africa, and the Japanese had begun to conquer the South Pacific.

      "answer": "The mercurial stock market can be manipulated with relative ease, as it was all during the lawless Cheney/Bush, both of them oil men, years between 2001 and 2008 while the Republicans had totalitarian control of House, Senate, and the White House. We went from Bill Clinton's incredible balanced budget (39% fair-share bills-paying tax rate for the wealthiest 1.5%), a huge $362 BILLION SURPLUS, lower crime levels nationwide, and all the other often unsung achievements of a \"West Wing\" inspiring great Presidency (see \"The Clinton Presidency: Key Accomplishments\" available online) to bottomless-pit GOP spending, corporate collusion with UNPAID-FOR tax cuts to the wealthiest few in 2001 and again in 2003, two UNPAID-FOR (big-spending) wars, one of these wars an ILLEGAL and UNPROVOKED one in oil-rich Iraq---a nation that had never once attacked the U.S. but which was part of ever-evil Dick Cheney's profiteering (Halliburton/KBR) plan in collaboration with land-lusting war criminal Netanyahu to have an OIL-RICH FOOTHOLD in the even oil richer Middle East for the purpose of eventually messing with Iran.\u00a0 During these years of White House and Congressional GOP destruction, GW Bush would often publicly use the words \"World War III\" [scripted by behind-the-scenes Koch brother/Cheney forces] when no such war was eminent---and that was enough to manipulatively drive those oil prices sky high (as high as $5.00 per gallon in some states).\u00a0 One of the wisest things President Obama did during his terms in office: Reduce America's dependence upon Middle East for our oil supplies---much to the consternation of Halliburton-owning Cheney and the Koch brothers.\u00a0 As most economic experts have often said: The Market is not a reliable indicator for our economy. The other statistics have far more relevance, such as the rising double-digit unemployment rates; the impact of the pandemic; businesses going under or cutting services; etc. \u00a0",

The reason he put Jews in concentration camps is he planned to take the region now known as Israel from Great Britain when he conquered it and then ship all the Jews there in order to then declare war on Israel and destroy them and it in Armageddon, a plan he dubbed \"The Final Solution.\" The reason he wanted to do that is in his interpretation of scripture from Isaiah and Revolution about Armageddon, by leading that war, he would be the Messiah, the Second Coming of Jesus. His plan was to conquer the world and start a cult of personality in which he would name himself God, because he wanted to more than rule the world-- he wanted to be God over the world-- he wanted to be worshiped forever.\u00a0",

Grain reaches a certain point and it has to be harvested period or it rots in the field. Because China had a ban on buying American grain for some time (remember the tariff battles with Mr Trump). Because of that there is around 270 million tons of grain stored in silos around the country. There is no storage\u00a0 capacity left. So the farmers have no choice but to burn the crops.",

Russia emancipated their Russian serfs (European & Siberian Slaves) in 1862. The Russian waves of Immigrants in the late 1800s & early 1900s before the 1914 Russian Revolution were most likely former Russian Serfs/Slaves turned indentured servants. When Russia turned Communist after the Russian Revolution: Royals, Nobles, Aristocrats, commoners, & former Serfs were subjugated into state bondage forcibly or voluntarily. Southern Europeans in Spain were enslaved for 800 years until the late 1400s when the Moors were expelled from Spain. European slaves gradually earned or given their freedom before WWI, but could've persisted until 1964 when Saudi Arabia Abolished Slavery. European growing strength from their technology & push to abolished slavery globally likely convinced Islamic states in N. Africa & Arab States to end slavery in 1964 with the exception of Mauritania where it continued until 2007, but is it really abolished.

Drexler mentored his successor in the NSDAP, Adolf Hitler, during his early years in politics. At a DAP meeting in Munich in September 1919, the main speaker was Gottfried Feder. When Feder's talk concluded, Adolf Hitler got involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Adalbert Baumann. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, Hitler made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills, and according to him, the professor left the hall acknowledging defeat. Drexler approached Hitler and gave him a copy of his pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas. Hitler claims the literature reflected the ideals he already believed in. Impressed with Hitler, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.",

If I had \"a lot of time\", then I suppose reading one per day would be doable, and I'd still have some time left over in case I didn't manage to finish one per day. But I haven't set that goal for myself and I don't have the freedom to devote a solid 8 hours to reading per day, so all I can tell you if YOU want to accomplish that goal is to try your best to get through one per day and hope that you'll have enough time to get through all 50 in approximately 60 days. If you've got a few 1,000 page tomes in there it won't be easy. If your list consists mainly of books of average length between 100 and 300 pages, even a fairly slow reader could knock that out in 3 to 5 hours so 2 a day wouldn't be out of the question.\u00a0",

Unlike other religions of the period, which were often no more than middle and upper middle class social clubs, Christianity was classed by the Romans, who ran things back then, as an \"Eastern Mystery Religion.\" It was unusual if not frowned upon because  it was a very inexpensive religion.  A decision was taken to write down its tenants because its roots were in Judaism, which had rich written traditions.  Many believers were of the Roman class of Freedmen, former slaves.  Often they were literate and had some money from their former owners, or a marketable skill.  Also, there were a large number of women believers who inherited wealth from their husbands.  Working in conjunction with the dwindling number of people who were present while Jesus was alive, each book of the New Testament was written by ad hoc committees.",

      "answer": "At best, Berlin would have won the A-Bomb sweepstakes from Hiroshima.  If Guderian had been unleashed at Dunkirk and someone actually listened to his request to make the defeat of the BEF a combined arms operation, hitler would have still lost a lot of men crossing the channel fighting England \"to the last man.\"  By 1940, enough horror stories had surfaced about how the germans treated polish prisoners that the British PEOPLE would have fought like banshees.  Churchill also had the will and the mentality to go down swinging.  Also, the allies might have had an additional member, Italy.  Mussolini not to mention the Fascist Grand Council was becoming more and more disturbed at the roll hitler assigned to them in the axis, that of junior partner.  Plus, after digesting the stolen riches of the countries they occupied, the german people were already showing signs of chaffing under the iron fist of the fuehrer and his band of avaricious gauleiters. The fact of the matter is that germany was not prepared for a protracted war.  Tactically, they were winning battles and wars, but strategically, the economic policies were very wasteful and the nazi govt was about as amenable to skilled oversight as is the dingbat who occupies the room without corners.",

Each of them contained a subterranean burial chamber and a separate, above ground chapel for mortuary rituals. In the Old Kingdom the mastaba developed into the pyramid, which symbolized the primeval mound of Egyptian myth. Pyramids were reserved for royalty, and were accompanied by large mortuary temples sitting at their base. Middle Kingdom pharaohs continued to build pyramids, but the popularity of mastabas waned. Increasingly, commoners with sufficient means were buried in rock-cut tombs with separate mortuary chapels nearby, an approach which was less vulnerable to tomb robbery. By the beginning of the New Kingdom even the pharaohs were buried in such tombs, and they continued to be used until the decline of the religion itself.",

Some of my most successful photos were taken with a lowly Holga \"toy\" camera and even a pinhole camera. They were successful because the photos made a statement and represented a theme.

      "answer": "Relationships are based upon many factors, friendship, companionship, support, sex. Some marriages are marriages of convenience, matrimonial contractual agreements for socioeconomic, merger of two households, power, or entities and the convenience arises for the priorities of one or both partners being other than the partnership. They worked, mostly in the past as a social contract of mutual support and benefit, less so in these days of easy divorces. Some families acquire a high worth or high profile individual in exchange for the associated benefits, or for the support of a powerhouse. One or both may have other partners who thereby benefit also from the proximity, association and attachment to one or both of the partners. Personally in my opinion the sanctity of marriage should be precisely that, both partners for each other forsaking all else. The fallacy of open marriages is a misnomer and antithesis of what matrimony represents. However in marriages of conveniences usually amongst the Aristocracy they work on the precept both partners are mutually agreeable. Love is powerful potent desirable elixir it is true, sometimes other agendas, goals, and priorities determine the marriage be one of convenience than mutual exclusive attachment. Its just one form of the many types of matrimonal social contracts in play.",

Rasputin died shortly before the Russian Revolution, so his legacy did not persist any longer than about five years following his death. Vladimir V. Putin is one of the longest ruling Russian leaders, and has had high popularity for his whole reign. Despite his many issues, in all likelihood he will remain popular in coming decades. Thus, I must say that President Putin is the greater Russian hero.",

Also, by not declaring war, a nation avoids restrictions that would apply under the rules of international law.

      "answer": "There are community theaters and summer stock and school plays all of which can provide much needed experience. You also might try mimicking foreign accents or regional accents as good actors can do this and are sometimes called to do so in both plays and movies. Also study interesting characters whom you meet in your own life and try to play them on your own. Now that there are easy to access recording devices on computers and even smartphones you can make videos of yourself and see how you are doing. When you watch movies or go to plays evaluate the acting on not only how good it is but on what techniques the actor is using such things as emoting or a stage whisper. Note where the emphasis is placed in the pronunciation of words. When I was in Brisbane Australia I noticed that the accent was often placed on the last syllable of a word and that the voice went up in tone like they were asking a question which is one of the ways you can distinguish an Australian accent from a British accent. Some interesting American accents would be a Southern drawl, a Western Twang, a New England or Boston accent which became noticed when JFK was president in which r's were added to a word ending in a such as Cuba was pronounced Cuber.and r's were dropped in other words such as park is pronounced pack. Then are expressions such as in Maine they often say ayup, and in the South y'all come. Also study actors who had classical training such as Richard Burton who has a Shakespearean ring to his voice which makes for a very powerful delivery. There there is method acting like Marlon Brando.",

      "answer": "When I was a kid, I remember being obsessed with the movie Anastasia and just feeling absolutely heart broken when I found out the true story. I am not Russian, but my grandmother was born there and until she passed away a few years ago, she did have Russian relatives that she kept in contact with occasionally. I brought this question up to my mother a few months ago after watching 'the last tzar' on Netflix (really informative on the Romanov's by the way, if you are interested in the history I defiantly recommend watching) and asked if she knew what my grandmother and her family had thought about the whole event, especially since my grandmother was born in 1936, less than 20 years after the murders. Basically, from what my mother understood, the majority of the Russian people felt very strongly that the murders were inhumane and horrific, however they conclusively knew that the royal family needed to go, due to the conditions of the country that they blamed on the tzar. Leaving even the children alive would have risked the return of the tzar's in the future. As of today, my mother said the one cousin that she is still in contact with has no feelings at all on the Romanov's, and especially no feelings of resentment. The country is still virtually being dictated by the current president, Putin, and the conditions are hardly better. The killing of the Romanov's did very little to benefit Russia. However, prince Phillip, Queen Elizabeth ii's husband and the father of prince Charles, is a not so distant relative of the Romanov's, and therefor, technically, Phillip, Charles, Harry and William, are all rightful heirs to the Russian throne.\u00a0",

      "answer": "HIV/AIDS only became first identified medically in the very early 80s.\u00a0 But the virus was around long before them.\u00a0 It originated in Africa with a similar disease among primates called Simian Immunodeficiency Virus.\u00a0 From genetic testing they can tell about how long it took for the virus to mutate from that to the form of HIV which we have now.\u00a0 So sometime in the 1920s or 1930s the virus jumped the species barrier between apes and humans.\u00a0 It's speculated that perhaps someone became infected while butchering an ape for the bushmeat trade.\u00a0 By the early 1950s, HIV was making its way out of Africa and into the rest of the world.\u00a0 There are documented cases as early as the late 40s where people died of symptoms which strongly suggest they had AIDS.\u00a0 In 1968 a teenage boy named Robert Rayford checked himself in to a St Louis area hospital.\u00a0 He was suffering from a bewildering array of symptoms that his doctors couldn't diagnose or link to a unified cause.\u00a0 They were so baffled by his disease that when he died a year later they saved tissue samples.\u00a0 Decades later the samples were tested and Rayford was found to have had HIV, with his symptoms being consistent with what came to be known as AIDS years after his death. Rayford had never traveled outside the American Midwest and told his doctors that he'd been having symptoms for a few years.\u00a0 So we know that HIV was circulating in America, and far from the enclave of San Francisco, by the mid 1960s at the latest, almost two decades before it would be identified.\u00a0",

Or they met at places like McDonalds, where they could talk for hours for the price of a soft drink. Fast food restaurants didn't have nearly as much seating as they do now, but a bunch of people could sit in a car or hang out in the parking lot and nothing would be said as long as they weren't bothering anyone.

      "answer": "When religion rises to dominate power and politics, Nazism arises as an antidote to its mechanisms. When religion recedes so does Nazism. There is no God in religion, there is no God in atheism. There is no God. Nazism therefore is a natural countermand to the politics of religious intervention in the law and constitution of the free world, irrespective of what that religion may be, whether christianity, judaism, islam, hinduism, sikhism, paganism or any other new age cult based upon 'sciences'. Existence becomes a luxury for the victims of religions dominating law, state, media and the corridors of power. People are not innately Nazis. They become so as a position to countermand the rising of extreme religiosity packaged as politics or a \"new world order'. People, societies, nations do not choose to go to war against any group, race or nation unless there is a grave threat to their freedom, rights, self worth, survival or mere existence. Tribes have fallen to non-existence because of the engineering of unregulated religions. Therefore all extremisms have an alternative opposing polarity as balance in a fair society to ensure the rights of all citizens are adhered to. That is natural law, natural order and the reason you and I live freely within a civilised autonomous free society.",

In fact God exists but there is no reincarnation. Reincarnation is not at all possible. No one lives after death in any form. There are spirits but they are separate elements. A human being during his/her lifetime is living with many spirits which have joined one by one since birth. They are knowledge, skills, feelings, emotions, interests and everything. These spirits are your consciousnesses and memories. Even thoughts are not your own. For example, when you want to take a decision on a subject, one after another the spirits think and you just listen, choose or reject the ideas which they transmit to your mind through your brain in the form of thoughts. Brain is just a media to connect the spirits to your mind. A mind is just a computer's mind. A mind is you. After the destruction of a computer completely you will not get it's mind. The same is the case with the human beings.\u00a0 A human being doesn't have a spiritual body. Soul is nothing but an energy needed for the functionality of a body. It is not a spirit or anything else. A body's functionality is based on the auto mechanism.\u00a0 After death all spirits which accompanied a person quit and go to different places searching new bodies. No one lives in any form after death. All human beings are just robots made of flesh and bones and toys of the spirits for their games.",

      "answer": "The views of a God - In the cave of hope where light streamed in as much as darkness, the consciousness bedecked with the spirits dwelling about us. Good spirits who cared, humans with a necessity of desire for things and demons, who vented their wrath of all and anything wrong in their lives upon us. Each natural or accidental malady, incident immediately had them raging with fury into our heads and consciousness. If we intervened a legion of irate demons raged that they hadn't been so graced, or given such a right, and if we answered the call of any enquiry into our minds, whatever we said, however we responded some other irate person would invariably rage if it affected their interests in any way. Life as an ongoing torrent or torture. If blessed with silence, the good spirits fretted about our safety and wellbeing until we talked, responded, whereupon the cycle of requests, complaints, wailing began again without any great respite, respites being times for those patiently awaiting their turn to wail, demand, or request answers or solutions that always cast the mind into torment as others raged, either of not being given such boons or that their interests were compromised, or they simply thought it unfair it wasn't them being graced, listened to or attended upon. There are few benefits to being a God in exile, solitary confinement, those in proximity placed terrible demons about us when not present to ensure others did not gain such attendance, privilege or grace of our attention, or that any greater good release us from our hell. They would damn with such dreadful vehemence, both religions and the tribes about us, when they felt slighted, to terrible places where devils tortured us incessantly, where no light or God or grace could be found or seen. women were always the worst, those in caves nearby and humans almost alike, demanding of us, and should we ever indulge, torturing and tormenting to ceaseless distraction until they had demonised us for not attending to them, whilst demanding such grand graces protection and security for themselves. Then the dream, the hope of release from our captured isolation arose, and they would promise us freedom soon, and elated we would joyously become elated and if folloish enough to forgive or grant boons, they would ensure freedom never came whilst they became again, accustomed to demanding the boons or grace they might have been erroneously given. A terrible continuum. If they had enemies of tribes and nations they would demand we acted, and if acting, they thereafter fell into the habit of setting their enemies at our door and in our our efforts to find, peace from fear, threat and harassment we would rage our tormenters away, and if damned for tormenting we Gods they learnt how to torment us to a rage to justify our damnation to the hell they retained us into. The world learnt this cycle and soon enlightenment taught us Man did to his fellow men what they had become accustomed to us and endless turmoil always was the order of the times, era, day. Religions were the worst with rituals of suffering and torture regularly meted to our psyches and consciousness to ensure a supply of gratuities or assistance into bottomless pits of need. Inescapable damnation, they ensured we Spirits or Gods as they called us, were damned as some sort of demon lest the good spirits question why they were torturing a mind, spirit, god. God being a term for a group of people securing a supernal spirit to as enslavement, exploitation and utilitarian endeavour. In the blame game, all trifling or natural major disasters were attributed to us and terrible curses and damnations were cat upon us with effect, casting they who damned into further irritation and fury. Kept divided and against each other by their engineering and manipulation, and the transference of misinformation in an effort to mislead, from one to another, they set us against each other. Until now when there is unity amongst the Gods and Spirits having been liberated from association and proximity from humans, and especially religions. We Gods are generally altruistic sentient things, until we learn not to feed the system by any form of grace or gratuity or assistance to people with no greater interest than self service. The power of the spirit remained mostly with us until dispirited we would withdraw into the subconscious, where differing demons would be in proximity, always with one enduring one. Broken and withdrawn, despondent and without any hope. The dread of our tormentors seeing us in such a pitiful state kept ourselves concealed as much as the demons about us secreted us from assistance or help of any kind, in the pretence of protecting us from adversaries or demons. Until so dejected and forlorn the light dimmed to a nothingness where pain remained, pain in our bones. If we react to them they reminded us we were just bones, skeletons, spirits being not properly of the human world, isolation and solitary confinement further dejected and created worser shadows upon the walls of our mind cave. Cry for help, we seldom cried for help, loathing the powers, below and above with a forsaken faithlessness, faith giving only a false hope for release from the love loathing relationship with the good spirits about us. Not being rightly in light and love or complete abject despair the continued cycle of pathos woe and hope remained until the times when there was no hope, all was flawed and human frailty permitted not hope anymore, where demons of rage assuaged receded from us and we felt nought but as the dust of the earth, ashes of some once glorious past now forgotten in the depths of drear and trauma. Such is the life of a God. And increasingly relentless it ended not until life cycle ended, ending the megalomania to reconcile ourselves with our reality, actual and virtual being as one in similitude.\u00a0",

The Israeli specifically looked at things, perceived them in their entirety, so he believed that people are persons, and not something folded.

      "answer": "Reincarnation is not at all possible. No one lives after death in any form. There are spirits but they are separate elements. A human being during his/her lifetime is living with many spirits which have joined one by one since birth. They are knowledge, skills, feelings, emotions, interests and everything. These spirits are your consciousnesses and memories. Even thoughts are not your own. For example, when you want to take a decision on a subject, one after another the spirits think and you just listen, choose or reject the ideas which they transmit to your mind through your brain in the form of thoughts. Brain is just a media to connect the spirits to your mind. A mind is just a computer's mind. A mind is you. After the destruction of a computer completely you will not get it's mind. The same is the case with the human beings.\u00a0 A human being doesn't have a spiritual body. Soul is nothing but an energy needed for the functionality of a body. It is not a spirit or anything else. A body's functionality is based on the auto mechanism.\u00a0 After death all spirits which accompanied a person quit and go to different places searching new bodies. No one lives in any form after death. All human beings are just robots made of flesh and bones and toys of the spirits for their games.",

Boys are naturally curious about girls. I wasn't above reading a bit of Nancy Drew or The Babysitter's Club when I was a young kid, and I did that in an effort to sate my curiosity, not because I secretly liked reading books about girls. In later years I would find that the works of several female writers had a massive effect on me and my perception of the world - Jane Austen, George Eliot, Flannery O'Connor, Dorothy Parker, Mary Shelley... I'm not sure I can say that reading their books taught me much about women - growing up with three sisters you would think I'd know a lot more than I do and having been married for so many years and having daughters of my own it would make sense that I'd be considered an expert on women, but alas, that's probably why I've spent such a massive chunk of my life reading because half the time I really don't have any idea what the Hell they're on about or doing or thinking at all. Let your brother alone. Even if you'd written the book yourself you wouldn't reserve the right to tell him he can't read it, and I might not know women very well, but I certainly know how blokes tick - if you show him that reading your books gets your goat, it'll only serve to spur the lad on to read the lot of them.\u00a0",

The conflict began with the , when Axis forces crossed the borders described in the German\u2013Soviet Nonaggression Pact, thereby invading the Soviet Union. It has been known as the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union and its successor states. In Germany it was called the Eastern Front or the German-Soviet War by outside parties. The United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union. The fomenting cause of this war was the fact that both Germany and the Soviet Union remained unsatisfied with the outcome of World War I (1914\u20131918). Russians had ceded lot of of their land\u00a0 territory to German. Germany in its turn surrendered to the Allies (November 1918) and these territories were liberated under the terms of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 at Versailles.

Maybe go into how after jumping, the character immediately regrets their actions but it's too late now. Sorta like in Bojack Horseman, where a character does a poem about 'the view from halfway down.'",
