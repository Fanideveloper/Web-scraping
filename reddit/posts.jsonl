    "I am doing some research into why the gold market seems so backwards.  Looking for insight and opinions to why it is so manipulated.  Thanks!",
    "Well. You can look at it from two ways. 1) if you look at it from physical supply and all the gold demand (99% of it is paper), then yes it\u2019s heavily manipulated. 2) but if you look at it from paper perspective, it\u2019s just a trading medium like any commodities that most 95% wont be converted.",
    "Now the question is if there is no paper contract as the trading medium, will there still be the same demand? Probably not. If the modern financial system is still tied to gold, it wouldn\u2019t have the expansion we did. (Not to say it\u2019s right or wrong) the fact is three is simply not enough gold for the demand to support the modern economy expansion. Thus under the current system, people\u2019s attention naturally shifted to equity and assets that yield returns. That being said, is the modern financial system sustainable? Probably not. No system can expand forever without reset. And gold is a self-correction instrument being used by people for thousands of years. The modern USD system is only 50yrs.",
    "Historically it has been manipulated by The Fed to drive the price down.",
    "I\u2019d explain it further but the article really does it better. But as a taster here\u2019s a fun story:",
    "The Fed held a fairly significant % of Germany\u2019s gold, and Germany got wind of the fact that they\u2019d been leasing their gold out, so they asked for it back, and in response The Fed said, Yeah sure, but give us seven years...",
    "Thanks for the info I am reading it right now.  From what I gather so far is the are shorting gold to keep the prices down since the paper gold is just a fraction of real gold.  Although it should be an even ratio.  By keeping the price down Asia is actually the one benefiting the most from these low prices, as they are accumulating the physical gold.  China does not allow gold to leave their country.",
    "So if the bubble was to burst and people wanted their actual gold there would not be any and paper gold becomes worthless and then Asia has the majority of the gold physical resources.  Is that close?",
    "I guess what isnt clicking yet is why would higher gold prices affect the Dollar so much? Like wouldnt you want it to rise since its finite and not as many people could purchase high quantities?  I just don't understand the purpose of keeping its value low",
    "The price of gold is manipulated because banks all over the world buy and sell paper gold IOU\u2019s of gold that they don\u2019t actually have, and in some cases gold that has not been produced, or never will be produced. The supply and demand function that controls the price of gold is broken because there is much more paper gold to buy and sell than there is physical gold.",
    " There are three major reasons ",
    " they manipulate the price lower.",
    "1: Gold's price is commonly seen as a barometer for the economy. If its price were allowed to skyrocket then people wouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security about our incredibly unstable and currently collapsing economy.",
    "2: If gold were allowed to have its price raise naturally then inflation, the way in which governments steal a significant portion of their spending money, would be much more obvious to the average person. Suppressing the price helps keep the average person ignorant to this theft.",
    "3: The people in power are buying as much of it as they can while it's priced so low. Central banks and governments around the world are buying record amounts of gold; typically you'd do best to copy whatever the smartest people in the room are doing.",
    "Thank you so much for you detailed response. Things are really coming together for me.  I do not have much physical gold/silver but I am working on it. I feel like I am a bit late to the party but hoping I can make a few good plays.",
    "I have been researching miners quite heavily and I understand very few deposits are being found with reserves ever decreasing.",
    "Manipulation makes a lot of money for those able to manipulate it. Simple.",
    "if you could print money like they do. u would want gold to be cheap so u can acquire more of it not less of it.  also gold is manipulated because they flood the market with paper-fake sell orders until the price stops going up.  they literally drive demand down with fake supply.  and it works because no one demands physical delivery :)",
    "My understanding is the western side actually has very little gold. Its all been flowing to Asia so they are the primary winners here.  Chinese government is also going a spending spree buying up gold mines. They are now the biggest gold owners by reserves.  Once they actually have enough to set the price the market will actually go utterly haywire. They will collapse the dollar and be the new owners of the world and make the rules",
    "Look into the petrodollar deal between USA and Saudi Arabia set up by Kissinger and Eisenhower... This was the cause of Iraq war 2. Saddam was about to start trading oil in Euros rather than USD. Fuck all to do with terrorists or WMD... Gold, oil and opium (Afghanistan occupation)... Thats the USA for ya. And now Data is a higher trading commodity than at least gold and oil",
    "swej",
    "It isn't.",
    "The price is a function of supply and demand, like with every other good.",
    "\"Why\" it is manipulated is an example of conspiracy thinking, thus it is no surprise you spend time on ",
    ".",
    "To not trust what I am being told and doing my own due diligence makes me a conspiracy theorist and I am ok with that.",
    "That's Hilarious!",
    "Tell us why DEMAND WAS AT ALL TIME HIGHS last March, when the price was knocked down into the 1400's.",

    "What is the different or benefits of owning real gold over investing in gld",
    "Physical all the way! If you don\u2019t hold it you don\u2019t really own it. That\u2019s often said as a mantra when it come to gold but it really is true.",
    "When you buy physical there is a 3-4% premium but then you are good as long as you store it in a secure place and you\u2019ve purchased from a trusted source. There is no counter party risk to your investment. This is extremely important in the current crazy times where nothing is really assured 100%. This is an extremely important concept as the reason you are using gold in the first place is as the ultimate safe haven asset for wealth protection. (In current times the wide consensus view is it is expected to grow significantly in value as well but that\u2019s a separate reason).",
    "Paper gold/ETFs are an elaborate investment vehicle that purportedly offers exposure to gold but in no way comes close to owning the actual thing in reality. This is for many reasons. They are meant to be backed up by real gold but often it is a shell game played with bullion banks and other entities where a lot of the gold supposed to be owned by the ETFs is not actually owned by them but leased by them and in any systemic breakdown many more people will be claiming that gold long before you. So in any of the worse case scenarios where you actually need to fall back on your \u2018gold investment/savings\u2019 you will end up being given dollars (which will be worth far less) and that too if lucky.",
    "These investment vehicles and the transactions surrounding them are frequently manipulated by the bullion banks for their own profits and by the Federal Reserve to control the perceived value of the US $ and all this works to keep the actual price of gold far below what it would otherwise be. So actually by participating in it you are actually then becoming part of the problem.",
    "The only real play with paper gold (which don\u2019t carry physical premiums and can be bought and sold instantly) would be for day traders and very short term investors looking to make quick money working extremely short term trades...speculators.",
    "Thank you!",
    "AAAU is a good in between. Guaranteed by the perth mint, you can turn your shares in at a minimum equivalent to a fractional. GLD basket minimums are way high",
    "This is what I went with for most of my holdings. Guaranteed by a stable government in a mineral-rich state. There is always going to be risk (mainly theft, but also government seizure, natural disasters, etc.) If i was super wealthy, I would probably keep it in a vault in Singapore. YMMV",
    "If you don't hold it then you don't own it, period. \"GLD\" is one form of what is known as \"paper gold\", IE a claim check of gold which 99% of the time has no actual physical gold to back it up. Why own an especially flimsy promise of gold when you can own the real thing instead?",
    "If you're an investor not looking to own gold for the long term and instead are just trying to make a buck speculating on its future price then GLD makes sense, but other than that there's really no reason to not buy real, physical gold.",
    "Risk of theft or the bank losing it (for a safety deposit box- this is apparently more common than I would have guessed) seem like large downsides to physically holding it. Vaulting in a stable, investment-friendly country seems like the best option to me if you have enough wealth to go check on it occasionally ( I don\u2019t lol).",
    "GLD is for speculating short term on price movements without getting hosed by $100 per ounce premiums.   GOLD is for leveraged speculation longer term on gold prices.  IAU is for buying options when you can't afford GLD options.   Gold is for buying and burying in your back yard with a case of SKS's.",
    "Gold you can hold GLD you can only see.",
    "If you are looking for stock market exposure to gold or precious metals, investing in mining companies is another way to benefit from an increasing gold price.  You can buy an index of gold mining companies, or you can do research yourself and figure out which ones you want to invest in."

Initially she couldn\u2019t find the main container she kept her coins in but found the little container with her \u201cjunk\u201d coins. The color popped out but I didn\u2019t look at immediately. We were looking up each coin smallest in size to largest on google - there were also several pesos and similar South American currency in addition the the real junk. When I got to the gold coin and started looking closely... well you know it was kind of an skeptical feeling that got more and more real looking at pictures online. Pretty exciting really.

Activists have theorized creative modes of exchange and put them into practice, these would include timebanking, LETS, labor-backed paper currency, community gardens and other forms of the commons, and other such voluntary associations.

Then maybe it would be worth thousands of dollars. I'm just going to have to do a deep and careful search when I get home, I think to myself.",
    "I got back to my home office started slowly scanning the room. That's when I saw it, an empty unmarked 10 oz tube that I remembered setting aside when I had unpacked my stash a week ago. I picked it up and it felt empty, but when I shook it I felt a subtle movement inside. I popped open the top and there it was! The five AGEs wrapped with foam and tape like I remembered.",
    "In retrospect, the mistake I made was not sealing and labeling the tube that I had stored the wrapped AGEs in like I did for my silver rounds. It looked and felt like an empty tube and I might have even tossed it out if I hadn't been actively searching for something.",

    "Hello I am looking to buy a gold chain. I have never purchased gold before, and would like some gold buying advice. I am planning to purchase one from a gold pawn store.",
    "A 18k 20inch, 5mm Cuban link gold chain with a weight of 41 grams is sold for $3,200.",
    "Question: Is the 41 grams the total weight of the chain, or the weight of only the gold.",
    "At the moment gold is 57$ per gram, if the chain is 41 grams, that means only 3/4 of the weight is gold which is 30 grams. Would that mean 30 x 57 = the material price of the gold?",
    "Should I be paying material price + craftsmanship when I am buying a gold chain? If so how much extra % do I pay on top of material price?",
    "I am very foreign to gold buying and want to look for the best deal. Thanks.",
    "In my opinion $3200 for a 41g 18k chain is an insulting ripoff. Yes. You will always pay a premium for craftsmanship. But you\u2019re looking at almost double the material cost. Hard pass if I were you. HARD pass",
    "At the moment gold is 57 per gram. 41g weight, is about 31 gram of gold weight. 31 x 57 is about 1750 for material gold.",
    "Would you say 1750 + 250craftmentship is worth for the chain. How much would you pay?",
    "Seems a bit light too it must be semi solid, I\u2019d avoid. Only buy solid links.",
    "The spot price + craftsmanship is correct.",
    "If it\u2019s for investment only buy coins and bars .. usually around spot + 4%",
    "Always buy from a 100% reputed source. A major bullion dealer online, or reputable coin store or jewelry or pawn shop. Bullion dealers often sell 1 Oz bracelets with a minimal workmanship charge.",
    "Check out Jacoje for decent prices on solid gold Cubans. He\u2019s out of stock on 18k 5mm cubans right but he\u2019s extremely helpful and has the weights and prices laid out on his website.",
    "They are rip off price. It\u2019s basically material + 500 markup",
    "Pawnshops can be good but you need to closely examine all the links and only buy solid weighty chains, if it feels light it\u2019s not. Remember they didn\u2019t pay spot price, haggle and be prepared to walk out . A lot of shops around and many are short of stock, hurting for cash flow, everyone can afford to pick up their pawned stuff with the govt support lately. They need your business, they can be fair and you know the scrap price you  just need to settle on a price per gram.",
    "That\u2019s very smart answer, now I have more points to haggle over.",
    "If its 18k then divide 18/24 and multiply that by the gold price to determine the gold value of the item youre buying. Usually jewelry is quoted as gross weight, including the nongold component",
    "The non-gold component is usually very cheap? Like 20-30$ at most, I would assume.",
    "Is the clasp on the chain also made with gold too?",
    "That is a horrible deal. I know there's a website that sells gold jewelry by weight - but I don't remember the name.",
    "Oh I just left a comment about this! It is ",
    "Check out ",
    " if you want a good price on your gold. It will be 24K but you will get a much better bang for your buck and they will always buy it back from you in the future for whatever the market price is at the time you\u2019re selling. Pretty sweet. I\u2019ve never used them personally but I know a lot of people vouch for and highly recommend their services.",
    "Some of the best Cuban chains are from CMG links in Miami. Their prices aren\u2019t bad and they hand make every bit of it. Don\u2019t buy anything below 18 karat. I have one of their bracelets and it is amazing."

    "Instead of the many \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u201d or \u201c$0\u201d answers, let me ask a few questions:",
    "1.) Was this unsolicited? If so, run.",
    "2.) Do you have, or have access to, a Sigma and/or XRF? If so, meet at a police station to do the test and exchange. 2b.) Do you have an LCS nearby that will test? A lot of people say \u201cOh, just go to your LCS, they\u2019ll test it for you.\u201d That\u2019s not necessarily the case. Most LCSs that I\u2019ve known are smart enough to know that you are conducting business outside their store which means a loss of revenue for them. Now, if you were to purchase something, even just a few generic rounds, they may be more inclined to help you. Or even if you tell them what\u2019s going on and offer them a few bucks. Having run my own shop (musical instruments, not coins) I would not allow outside business to be conducted in my shop. I had a guy hanging around offering to do private lessons while we offered them in the shop! The same principle applies here.",
    "3.) What red flags are you noticing? Trust your gut. The fact that you\u2019re asking here says to me that you already have some reservations. It is better to miss out on a good deal than to lose all the money on a gold plated piece of tungsten.",

Even if you charged a fee, why expose yourself to the liability of possibly making a $$$$ mistake to earn $, if you're liable for mistakes?  If you're not liable, then your appraisal opinion is idle and worthless.  Such an opinion is not worth anything, because the customer can't act on it.",
    "Consider the reverse problem, where you the expert  tell somebody their piece is fake, or that you can't be sure or can't tell.  These cases certainly occur.  Who wants to get involved in that kind of turmoil for no gain?",
    "Rendering an opinion on something being traded on the Facebook?  That's essentially injecting yourself into the middle of somebody else's quarrel, or possibly a criminal con job.",
    "Many LCSs advertise that they do free estate appraisals.  This is because they have a good chance of buying an estate lot.  Not that they invite you to bring in random pieces that are not really up for trading.",
    "When I ran a one-man stand-alone retail shop (in a different line of business), the entire world treated me as an open door for their salesmen to come in and waste my time all day long, or seeming customers who were actually there to try to sell me their used junk.  I have to sympathize with the LCS operator who has a stream of busybodies walking in all day, asking for opinions on mystery pieces that are not on offer.",
    "Can you imagine being a banker, and having customers wander in wanting to chat about inflation or the stock market, instead of transacting business?",
    "Not much unless I had a  Sigma Metalytics Precious Metal Verifier.",

    "The reason is because desperate people and institutions are seeking liquidity. This demonstrates how gold does EXACTLY what we want it to do: in a time of dire straits, gold can save you. Millions of people around the world right now, especially in Asia, are liquidating their gold, not because they want to, but because they have to. This will keep gold's price somewhat mild for the next months, but expect that when things begin to really calm back down, those same individuals and institutions will need to increase their gold holdings again, as well as there being a reduced confidence in the US Dollar and other fiat currencies going forward, and gold price will surge again. The same thing was seen in and after the 2008 global recession",

Not only are things are expensive because of inflation and they\u2019re being sold out due to demand being so high. With that being said I say the US dollar isn\u2019t the best way to save right now. I\u2019m sticking with gold eagles because if I want to liquidate it\u2019s easier than liquidating stock. And let\u2019s not forget that when it comes to paying a mortgage in a hyper inflation situation financial institutions will be welcoming gold with open arms.",
    "I\u2019m not saying that stock because I\u2019m good to invest in because it produces far much more in the market than gold. What I am saying is I need something tangible to help me sleep better at night because I know I could barter and trade with a precious metal then I can with stock.",

I guess the first thing I can off is to buy from a reputable source like APMEX, JM Bullion etc. There are also private sellers on Reddit too but you need to look at their feedback prior to making any purchases from them. Gold and Silver are long term investments not a stock meaning its a way to preserve your money dont expect to get rich off of it I mean you could but thats not the point for most of us small investors. Whatever you do take it slow its not a race to the top just a couple of catch phrases you will here \"if it sounds to good to be true it probably is\" and my favorite \"If you dont hold it you dont own it.

    "First google spot price of gold. This is the baseline price of gold today (it\u2019s based on people trading gold by the kilogram). When you\u2019re buying bars or coins there will be a premium you pay over spot price. Bars have less premium than coins (government minted/backed). The bigger piece of gold you buy, the less premium. Some states you pay sales tax if you buy less than $1500 of precious metals. Check out local coin shop and online dealers like jmbullion. Try to avoid paying with card because they charge you the processing fees and do a wire transfer. Reddit pmsforsale is also great",

    "Gold bullion in the UK is VAT free (silver and platinum is not).",
    "All UK coins made by the Royal Mint are CGT (capital gains tax) exempt. CGT comes in to play when you sell an asset for a profit. If you make too much profit in one financial year, you will have to pay CGT. No other coins (Australia, Canada, USA, ect...) are CGT exempt. No gold bars (including Royal Mint) are exempt from CGT.",
    "Spot price determines the bullion cost of gold. When buying you want to keep the premium you pay (as a percentage over spot price) to a minimum. A collectable coin (numismatic) will incur an extra premium when you buy, and hopefully receive an extra premium when you sell. If your gold has no additional numismatic value, then you sell it as just bullion, and you want to negotiate a sale price as close to spot as possible.",
    "UK 24k gold coins come in whole or fractions of 1 troy ounce. The exception to this being the 22k sovereign which is 0.235 of 1 troy ounce. You would buy a fractional coin as opposed to a 1 oz coin because, when you want to sell you might want to sell a smaller amount. More people will be able to afford your smaller coin making it easier to sell. The drawback to this is that smaller coins are more expensive to buy (as a percentage over spot) than bigger coins.",
    "This ",

I suggest you become a member of thesilverforum.com where you can ask questions of mostly UK members who are mostly friendly. There are also classified ads there for buying and selling precious metals (like ",

    "I think that's it. Happy stacking.",
    "Would you still recommend Bairds & Co as a place to buy or one to avoid?",
    "And in terms of coins and bars, is it just a matter of preference or is one better than the other in terms of investment?",

    "You should think of creating a stack as a way to save money. It shouldn't ",
    " be a conventional investment (you can invest by speculating, but this is risky and I don't recommend it if you're just starting out). The reason stacking is better than a savings account however, is that unlike currency in an account, bullion and other commodities are much, MUCH less affected by inflation, and totally protected from inflation due to quantitative easing (where the government just prints money).

I think you are really doing the right thing by putting money aside in gold. It will prevent you from spending on unnecessary things, and when time comes you will have a nice nest egg/cushion.",
    "As for where to buy in the UK, I wouldnt know. Hopefully some of the other members can help you with that.",

    "I\u2019d highly recommend buying government minted coins (eagles, maples, etc) over bars because they\u2019re more accepted as genuine and easier to sell. Even more so if they\u2019re certified (by NGC or PCGS). There is a lot of fake gold out there from China and I personally will not buy uncertified gold\u2014the slight premium is worth it and helps me sleep at night.",
    "Local coin shops and coin shows are the best place to buy. Depending on your local sales tax, it may be worth driving across a state line if you can save several hundred bucks. For online, ModernCoinMart is my favorite, and Apmex has a great reputation as well.",
    "Lastly I recommend a quality $1000 gunsafe, which you can bolt into a concrete floor or even build into a hidden wall if you care to. Get the thickest steel you can afford. I recommend this because in an emergency the government can close banks for as long as they like, don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll be able to get into your safe deposit box."

    "Haha, thing is, my country is really small and the government does care about transactions a lot, we also need license for selling pearls (since it is very common here) so I\u2019m guessing we do need a license for gold and other precious metals. (Also they can catch illegal transactions quick, we\u2019re like only twice the size of Manhattan lol)",
    "Do you need a license? That would depend on where you live. In the United States, no. If you're planning to buy gold for the long term then where you buy and what you buy specifically would depend on how much you're looking to purchase. If you're doing a large purchase (hundreds of ounces) then bars would be the way to go, but if you're looking to buy less than that then you might consider buying coins over bars. They're less likely to be counterfeit than small gold bars, and they tend to be easier to sell when that time comes. They come at a slightly higher premium, but you also tend to get some of that premium back when it comes time to sell, too.",

They charge fees, and shipping. So you will pay around $1900 to hold your gold from vaulted. Now they make it easy, because you are making payments. But I don't think right now you will ever make a profit. Remember gold is a standard, it is worth the same thing allowing for inflation, that is was worth during the civil war. In my view, vaulted is the only one making money on gold right now.",

A kilo of AGEs is cheaper than a gold kilobar, counting proving costs.  Plus these costs are assessed every time the metal changes hands.  With coins only the first buyer pays the assay/minting costs; every subsequent owner gets that for free.",
    "So don't fall for the pricing swindle of buying bars at apparently small premiums.  The true premiums and fees are excessive.  It's similar to the no-load mutual fund game.  You can only buy at a discount because you must sell at a larger discount.",

Secondly it would be about the spread which will be smaller with an ETF than whatever a physical shop will charge you. Thirdly I would say security, not just on the storage but around the entire physical liquidation process.",
    "ETF's have their place in the overall gold ecosystem, they are in some ways just a different extension of trust. ETF's are a trust in the company issuing them isn't going to go bust and physical is a trust the shop isn't selling you gold plated tungsten.",

    "My theory is that ETFs are much more liquid in case a stock market \"Mother of All Buying Opportunities\" situation occurs. However if the physical gold crowd is right then a certain percentage in physical maintains the equity in case the ETFs outright fail and physical goes through the roof. So the answer like endlessloads said is both.",
    "The popular ETFs benefit from much lower bid/ask spreads. Physical you might pay 10-15% over spot. On top of that you may get less than spot when selling. You might need a 30% move to profit if you used it as a trading vehicle. So it\u2019s definitely for long term accumulation/wealth preservation/inheritance, not for capturing small gains."

There are several mints that have gone out of business, such as from being shut down by law enforcement for money laundering or smuggling.

    "Brands that are widely counterfeited tend to unfairly discount genuine pieces.  Naive buyers will be shy of the risk.  If it takes an expert dealer to authenticate your piece, then you can be sure it will be discounted from what a recognized piece will command; the dealer knows it's only worth what his buyer traffic will pay, less a hefty spread.",

I don\u2019t plan on selling for a minimum of 20 years, realistically 30. When I retire I hope to have around $250k-$300k in gold and silver and live off of that for my first few years of retirement, travel the world with my wife, enjoy our first few years of being retired while still being young. And during that few years our retirement savings will be making peak returns because of the size of the investment account. Then I\u2019ll start pulling my retirement funds and social security (haha like that\u2019s even gonna still exist) and live out my later years probably buying more gold and then leave it to my son",

Like on the 10 peso, the back is the cool eagle emblem of Mexico but the \u201cdiez peso\u201d is on the front so I show the front so people can distinguish the denomination. On the Coronas it is displayed on the back \u201cX cor\u201d for 10 corona and \u201cXX cor\u201d for 20. Lots of sovereigns just have a persons face on the front, the most popular being Queen Elizabeth. Every coin collector is sick of the old bags face so the tails end is usually preferred. I just put a description of what I have in the comments to let people know but overall, whatever side you like most or has the most unique and interesting artistry is usually preferred.

    "The U.S. rules are complicated, but in many common cases there is no automatic reporting to the federal government.  However states will typically require pawn shop documentation (ID, thumbprint) when you sell gold to dealers, not for taxation, but as a policing regulation to deter fencing stolen gold.  Selling gold to a dealer in my state is a bit creepy that way, you feel a bit like you're assumed guilty of some heist.",
    "You who are under the U.S. tax regime ",
    " owe a stiff capital gains tax when you sell or barter gold for more dollars than your basis in it.  Whether the sale is reported or not, whether it was sold to a dealer or a casual sale to friend, whether you bought it or received it as a gift or won it in a poker game!  Not reporting your sales to the feds, and not paying the tax, is a tax violation, possibly criminal.  The fact that you might get away with nor reporting because it was a secret or undocumented cash transaction, does not change the fact of your legal obligation and violation if you fail to report.",
    "Same thing with lying about your basis in the gold, or not having documentation of your basis.  If you don't have documentation, the tax man will assume the worst basis that is reasonably likely.  That's one reason to prefer fresher dates on coins; the basis can't be held against you for lower-price years prior to the minting.",
    "would it be a better idea to develop a high-trust group of acquaintances and friends who are always interested in buying/selling gold for cash?",

    "Nobody likes this U.S. tax regime (except the one political party that keeps it in place).  Even if it is a grand injustice inflicted upon us by despots, ",
    "To own gold as a U.S. person is to face a dilemma: you either retain value in your holdings and evade the tax, or you obey the law and lose money on it.  Because gold cannot be expected to rise in value (it has no income/dividends/capital-appreciation, just nominal inflation gains), it is a wasting asset due to U.S. taxation of inflated capital gains treatment.",
    "i believe any transaction over 10k value needs to be reported. so split it up over two days.",

    "Only gold sales of 1Kg or more in gold or 25 Oz or more in certain foreign coin bullion (like Krugerrands) are reported by the store to the IRS. Otherwise smaller quantities are not reported by the bullion companies buying from you. This page by APMEX the country's largest dealer explains it all clearly.",

My savings account doesn't earn interest and I have no intent on investing money in the stock market.  Is this a bad idea?  Where would I store it safely?",
    "I feel like buying at such small amounts means I will be wasting money buying at more above spot price.  At the same time money that I save in gold means I won't be able to quickly spend it on some stupid thing, unlike if I put money in the stock market or bonds where I could quickly cash out.  Advice appreciated.",
    "Hey there! While gold is a great store for value, it should absolutely only be a portion of your savings. It's smart to diversify, and honestly the shift should be on having safe savings first and foremost.",
    "My recommendation (if you aren't already)",
    "Savings account or Money market account with enough of an emergency fund to last you a few months.",
    "A retirement account IRA/401k or similar depending on where you live",
    "A mutual Fund, or selected dividend stocks.",
    "Gold and other precious metals.",
    "Gold is great, but is hard to get into profit. It's a fantastic hold of value, however; it's not widely accepted as liquid currency.  As a young person (I assume) you benefit from fluctuations in the market and riskier investing will overall be a better use of your money in the long run than gold will. I'm not saying don't buy gold, only that it should truly be done in conjunction with traditional savings and investing. I too have the gold bug, so every time I want to buy I have to slap my hand and remind me that I have more important savings goals that are a higher priority.",
    "You definitely have a fair point.  I guess what I was basing this on is the assumption that gold will generally over larger periods of time increase in value.  While I'm not banking on $9000 gold in 10 years I also feel like it's a safe investment for a solid(ish) return over the long haul.",
    "I definitely feel like the mutual fund is a good idea because other people are taking care of your money and compounded returns and re-investing do magic all else equal.  I think I can benefit from a healthy balance of the few.  I like the idea of gold because it's generally stable and low-risk, but I also have a lot of time to make riskier investments.",
    "edit: I also want to add that I'm looking more for a return and not just stable currency.  I guess the problem I noticed after taking a quick look into Vanguard mutual funds (it's just a name I know) they seem to all have pretty high minimum investments starting at $3000, which is more than I would be willing to spend at the moment since I still want a solid amount of spending cash.  I like that with gold I can spend in increments and not be controlled by some large entity.",
    "I also don't have income per se at the moment, more just a part time job that.  I would definitely make more contributions into riskier investments once I have more to spend.",
    "Are you talking about buying $500 worth of gold at a time, or taking ",
    " of the $500 you earn to put in gold? If you\u2019ll be putting in $500 at a time you won\u2019t be paying super terrible premiums over spot.",
    "Gold and silver are great because it satisfies the urge to spend money on something, but also acts a savings and something you can hold and enjoy.",
    "If you\u2019ll only be spending $20-$100 at a time I\u2019d say consider going with silver, but it adds up quick and ends up taking a lot of physical space.",
    "I would definitely go with a ten gram bar each time I buy, which posts around the $500 mark.  I worry about the volatility though.  In the last year gold was around $1450 per oz, but now pushing 1800.  I guess the assumption that gold will rise over time in general saves worry from a few hundred dollars fluctuation when buying, but you still feel like you got a bad deal if you know what I'm saying.",
    "Is it a good idea? Yes.",
    "Where would you store it safely? Either at home, on your person, or both.",
    "You do pay higher premiums on fractional gold, but the premiums aren't too high on 1/4th oz coins or larger, which at the time of posting this cost ~$500.",
    "Do you think it's a good idea just to bite the bullet with the high prices right now or wait until the prices drop to pick some up?",
    "Also do you think you could explain the large price jump (300/oz) from March to April of this year?  Clearly something virus related but I can't quite wrap my head around it.",

    "Max Out IRA contribution. Then put rest into the regular brokerage account.",
    "Now, I would put $3-4K to work in the IRA account. Go with ETFs only. Spread it out across sectors and countries; To learn how to invest, you need skin in the game. You need to feel the highs of winning and the lows of losing.",
    "What you will discover is that skin in the game means you will start paying attention. You will listen to \"experts\" and journalists. You will listen to their sales pitch and start noticing patterns. You will start becoming able to separate the bull from the interesting.",
    "You will start learning the jargon and doing your own due diligence. You will pay attention to all sorts of markets and learn about things you never really thought about. Oil futures, bond auctions, yield curves, forecasted EPS, cyclicals, BRICs, value vs. growth, blue chips, the difference between the DOW, S&P, Russel and Wilshire, gold and copper, emerging markets, sectors, earnings seasons, flight to quality, spot markets, inflation and unemployment, etc.",
    "As your self-education unfolds you will want to tweak your holdings. If you want to hold gold for investments, you can hold shares in a gold ETF.",
    "Buy a 90-day treasury Bill. Go through the steps",
    "As you get more comfortable, you can dribble more $ to play, knowing all the while, you can lose 50% of your investment at any given time, especially if it is not well diversified.",
    "When happy, buy a 1/10 oz krugerrand or American eagle and maybe a UK sovereign. Follow these and learn about the physical gold market with its premiums, bid-ask spreads, etc.",
    "Learn about the Fed. Try to watch how Fed moves affects the markets.  Watch how national policies in the US and elsewhere impact markets.",
    "Watch CNBC, Bloomberg TV  and other such programs.",
    "Do lots of things with little at stake so you can ramp up your self-education. This is the perfect market to do so.",
    "Meanwhile, keep working hard and building up capital to invest in a more serious way.",
    "You won\u2019t pay extreme premiums for $500 in gold. You could easily buy a 1/4 ounce coin and it wouldn\u2019t be too far off a larger quantity.",
    "You can open a brokerage and buy gold stocks.",
    "I definitely would recommend that over storing completely in cash (which is devaluing at an alarming rate). As long as you have enough cash on the side just incase.",
    "100%",
    "buy silver and gold . imo wait until premiums go down a bit",
    "Youtube hidden secrets of money by mike maloney",
    "Take it from someone who's had money in the back for the last 5 years. I feel like it's done absolutely NOTHING for me. You're on the right track. Invest in different things (safer stock, precious metals [plat, silver, and gold], bitcoin) and you will see you're self ahead of the game.",
    "As far as concern over paying premiums to spot goes, for smaller amounts like $500, the premiums tend to be there both when you buy and sell. You will basically be owning something with more value from being in coin form and less gold value. This changes what your purchase is sensitive to, in this case numismatic value, but doesn\u2019t make the buy inferior. Essentially , the correlation will be lower to gold."

Even the US mint upped their premium on ASE mid year to the 9 distributors they supply in the US(which hasn\u2019t happened in 13 years). However premiums have dipped and will continue to. Most companies the size of Kitco or even about half as big are in with these companies for pennies over spot. I can\u2019t believe people are paying +7 over on boxes of 2020 ASE but I love it.

    "What is the value of the pre-1933 coins compared to getting a modern 1/10th,1/4th, half ounce or ounce golden eagle coin? I noticed that the pre-1933 gold coins have a troy ounce spot that is much much lower than the standard .999 gold content of the golden eagles. When I look at the prices for the pre-1933 coins on APMEX or Money Metals Exchange, the price is significantly higher than the actual value of gold in the coins. Is the cost of the coins higher because of their age and rarity, making them more valuable from a historical stand point? I am a big history nerd really tempted to order a few, but I don't have the most expendable income right now and want to make sure I get the most bang for my buck picking up new gold.",
    "They are generally rarer, more scarce, and harder to find in great condition as these were circulating coins, and commonly put into jewelry. The US government also recalled gold coinage in 1933 so a lot of it was destroyed. They are all 90% pure gold - the greater alloy content made them more durable to stand up to circulation as gold by itself is a relatively malleable metal. They do cost more for their gold content but you are paying for numismatic value and greater scarcity as well - so you aren\u2019t really losing you money in the greater premiums as that numismatic / scarcity value doesn\u2019t disappear when you buy them. The mint cranks out new bullion coins every year. These will likely never be produced again.",

    "I would probably prefer 24k gold as well as, but as far as handling 24k gold goes I hear its actually quite malleable compared to say 22k.",
    "I too just transitioned into gold from silver.  Unlike \u201cgetting silver\u201d to stack weight, I find myself a little more picky about what gold I\u2019m stacking.  To your point, pre33 gold is 10% copper and as long as you aren\u2019t paying premiums for a 63+ slabbed coin you can really handle them all you want.  I\u2019m not saying to carry it around and use it to decide who is going first, but if I had any pure 24k gold I\u2019d never touch it."

    "beautiful bar, no doubt about it. I have to ask though, cause this is something I've been thinking about: bigger bars have smaller premiums over spot, which is great.....but doesn't the chance of forgery go up as well? and with no assay card to top it off... I mean, part of me feels like smaller bars are less worth the investment to duplicate for forgers, but bigger bars offer them much more incentive. Does anyone else struggle with this internal dilemma too?",
